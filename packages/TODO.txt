Here’s what’s missing:

⸻

4️⃣ OpenID4VCI (Credential Issuance Protocol)

This is required by virtually all EUDI-compatible systems.

You need:
	•	Interaction request builder
	•	Credential offer parsing
	•	Token exchange
	•	Credential retrieval
	•	Binding to wallet keys

Equivalent to:
issuerClient = new OpenID4VCI.Issuer(...)
const credential = await issuerClient.requestCredential({...})



5️⃣ OpenID4VP / SIOPv2 (Presentation Protocol)

For wallet → verifier communication.

You need:
	•	Building authorization requests
	•	Handling redirects
	•	Responding with signed presentation
	•	Nonce/challenge support
	•	JARM-style encapsulation


6️⃣ EUDI-specific encoding formats

❗ REQUIRED FOR 2026 COMPLIANCE:
	•	EUDI JWK-format public keys (JCT)
	•	JWS-wrapped credentials
	•	Canonicalized JSON (JCS)
	•	EU-specific metadata
	•	Trust framework alignment

You’re already halfway there because you have:
	•	JCS
	•	JWS
	•	P-256 & Ed25519
	•	Multikey

You just need to expose them in crypto-ops in a structured EU-friendly way.



7️⃣ Trust Framework Integration

EU wallet developers MUST have:
	•	Trust list verification
	•	Certificate chain validation (for issuers)
	•	Signature-checking against DID or trusted authority
	•	Trust anchor resolution

This is optional for your base SDK but usually required.



8️⃣ Key Management Layer

Wallet developers also need:
	•	Generate P-256 keys
	•	Generate Ed25519 keys
	•	Store keys securely
	•	Recover keys
	•	Rotate keys
	•	Export public keys in EU-acceptable formats (JWK, JCT, Multikey)

This is exactly what crypto-ops is for.
