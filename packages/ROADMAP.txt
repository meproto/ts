⭐ ReallyMe = Wallet + Credential Issuance + Trust Layer

…and the SDK is how developers integrate DID:ME + Credentials + Verification into their apps (mobile or server).

That is precisely what the EU Digital Wallet ecosystem needs and is missing: a developer-friendly turnkey stack.

Let’s go through each component and map them into your architecture.

⸻

⭐ 1. ReallyMe is the Wallet

This is crucial:
	•	You control the key management
	•	You control the holder binding algorithm
	•	You control the private key storage
	•	You control the secure enclave / Android Keystore integration
	•	You control recovery and rotation
	•	You control DID updates
	•	You control credential storage and presentation policies

This means:

✔ Wallet keys are proprietary → they belong in the ReallyMe app, not the SDK.

✔ The SDK exposes only public wallet interactions, not private key material.

The SDK gives app developers the ability to:
	•	Ask ReallyMe app for a DID
	•	Ask ReallyMe app for a signed presentation
	•	Verify credentials
	•	Request issuance

You are effectively building the Apple Wallet of digital identity, backed by DID:ME.

This is perfect.



⭐ 2. You help Issuers issue credentials

This is the other side of the ecosystem.

Issuers need:
	•	A server-side library (Go, TS) to issue DID:ME credentials
	•	A key management solution (provided by ReallyMe CA)
	•	Credential schemas & templates
	•	Cryptosuite helpers
	•	JWS or DI-proof signing
	•	Revocation / status support
	•	Trust anchoring

Your SDK fills all these gaps by providing:

@meproto/credential
	•	Create credential
	•	Validate credential
	•	Apply cryptosuite
	•	Schema enforcement
	•	DID binding
	•	Encode into EUDI-compatible formats

And:

@meproto/crypto-ops
	•	JWS signing for credentials
	•	Preimage building
	•	JCS canonicalization
	•	JCT formatting
	•	Algorithm dispatch (ES256, Ed25519, PQC later)

And:

Your Trust Layer (more below)

This gives issuers a single API call:

const cred = issueCredential({
  schema: "did:me:Person",
  subject: userDid,
  claims: { name: "Alice", ageOver18: true }
});


⭐ 3. You run a Trust Layer (issuer certification authority)

THIS is the killer feature.

EU wallet model requires:
	•	Trusted Issuers
	•	Trusted Attesters
	•	Trusted Providers
	•	Certificates tied to Issuer keys (x.509 or DID Document)
	•	Signed metadata about Issuer authority
	•	Status endpoints

You said:

We run a certificate authority for easy trust assurance—think EV SSLs.

This becomes:

🔥 ReallyMe Trust Registry

A service that:
	•	Validates issuers
	•	Maintains issuer metadata
	•	Issues certificates
	•	Publishes status
	•	Provides verifiers with trust anchors
	•	Provides wallets with trusted issuer lists
	•	Provides revocation lists

This is exactly what makes the SDK valuable.

Your SDK then gives developers:

const trusted = await trustRegistry.verifyIssuer(credential.issuer);


Or

const issuer = await trustRegistry.lookup(credential.issuer);



⭐ 4. The SDK itself (for mobile apps & servers)

Yes — your SDK becomes the developer entry point to DID:ME identity, credentials, and presentation.

The SDK includes:

A. DID Layer
	•	Create/update DID (typically via ReallyMe wallet)
	•	Validate DID Document (server-side)
	•	Resolve DID
	•	Use DID keys for credential binding

B. Credential Layer
	•	Issue credentials (server-side issuers)
	•	Validate credentials
	•	Transform credentials for EU formats
	•	Status/revocation checks

C. Presentation Layer
	•	Create signed presentation
	•	Validate presentations
	•	Handle challenge/nonce
	•	Bind to wallet keys via ReallyMe

D. Crypto-Ops Layer
	•	JWS signing / verifying
	•	JCS canonicalization
	•	EU JCT public key formatting
	•	Multikey handling
	•	Secure preimage building

E. Trust Layer Integration
	•	Issuer certs
	•	Trust lists
	•	Lightweight CA verification

This is the complete vertical stack.


⭐ 5. Architecturally, the SDK layers should be:
@meproto/crypto            → primitives
@meproto/codec             → encoding
@meproto/crypto-ops        → crypto + encoding actions
@meproto/did               → generic DID logic (resolve, validate)
@meproto/didme             → did:me method-specific logic
@meproto/credential        → credential issuance + validation
@meproto/presentation      → VP creation + validation (optional)
@meproto/trust             → registry integration (trusted issuers)
(runtimes)
@reallyme/app              → the actual wallet
This is a perfect EU wallet SDK structure.

⭐ MEPROTO = the protocol layer (open, public, spec-aligned)

This is the foundation:
	•	cryptographic primitives
	•	encoding (multikey, multibase, JCS)
	•	crypto-ops (signing, verification, JWS, JCT)
	•	DID method logic (did:me)
	•	credential data model and schemas
	•	presentation formats
	•	resolver logic
	•	future OpenID4VCI/OpenID4VP plumbing
	•	spec compliance + interoperability

MEPROTO should contain all the standards-based, protocol-centric tools, usable by:
	•	The ReallyMe app
	•	Issuers
	•	Verifiers
	•	Third-party developers
	•	Other wallets
	•	Anyone building decentralized identity flows

Think of MEPROTO as:

🔥 “The engine room of the identity system.”

It is the technical substrate.

It is not opinionated about UX, not tied to any particular wallet, and not handling user-facing flows.

⸻

⭐ REALLYME SDK = the wallet + trust + service integration layer (proprietary, developer-facing)

This is the product layer, the equivalent of:
	•	Apple Wallet APIs
	•	Google Wallet APIs
	•	Stripe.js (for payments but you for identity)
	•	Auth0 SDKs
	•	Clerk / Stytch APIs

This layer depends on MEPROTO, but is not part of the ME Protocol itself.

It contains:

✔ Real wallet-specific behavior
	•	Key vault / secure enclave integration
	•	Backup & recovery
	•	Device binding
	•	User authentication (passkeys, biometrics)
	•	DID lifecycle tied to a user account
	•	Credential storage UX
	•	Local presentations
	•	Secure presentation sharing
	•	Auto-updates and revocation syncing

✔ Trust layer bindings
	•	Requests to the ReallyMe trust registry
	•	Fetching issuer certificates
	•	Validating DID:ME issuer keys against your CA
	•	Checking status endpoints
	•	Getting attester lists

✔ Developer utilities
	•	“Login with ReallyMe” (SIOPv2 style)
	•	API calls to ReallyMe cloud
	•	Receiving/verifying presentations from the wallet
	•	Issuing credentials using a server integration flow
	•	Simplified issuer tooling

✔ A polished DX layer

This is the layer developers enjoy:


import { loginWithReallyMe, issueCredential } from "@reallyme/sdk";



🔵 MEPROTO — Public Open Identity Stack
@meproto/crypto
@meproto/codec
@meproto/crypto-ops
@meproto/did
@meproto/didme
@meproto/credential
@meproto/presentation


These provide the identity engine, usable by ANY wallet or issuer.

🟣 REALLYME — Proprietary Wallet & Trust SDKs

@reallyme/wallet-sdk        (mobile SDK)
@reallyme/server-sdk        (issuers/verifiers)
@reallyme/trust             (trust registry bindings)
@reallyme/app               (actual iOS/Android wallet)


This gives:
	•	seamless integration
	•	strong UX
	•	trust assurances
	•	onboarding wizards
	•	API calls to ReallyMe backend

But REALLYME SDK does NOT replace MEPROTO.
It builds on MEPROTO.

MEPROTO remains your open standards-based foundation.

Developers want to know:
	•	“Is this user 18+?”
	•	“Is this a real human?”
	•	“Has this identity been verified (not a bot)?”
	•	“Does this user live in country X?”
	•	“Does this user have a verified email/phone?”
	•	“Is the user’s DID trustworthy? Is it certified by ReallyMe CA?”


////


Credentials developers will issue or require:
	•	Age Over 18
	•	Age Over 21
	•	Real Human Verified (anti-bot proof)
	•	Government-ID Verified (person has scanned ID in wallet)
	•	Face Match Verified
	•	Selfie-Liveness Verified
	•	Birth Date Credential
	•	Country of Residence
	•	Nationality

This category alone is worth billions — this is exactly what Agecheck.me / ReallyMe solves for app devs.


These are required by almost every app on earth.

Credentials:
	•	Verified Email Address
	•	Verified Phone Number
	•	Verified Social Handle
	•	Verified Device Ownership
	•	Verified Account Recovery Methods
	•	Verified Push Notification Channel

Developers want one-liners:
